# Financial-Data-Science-Final-Project
Final year project containing web scraping techniques to predict price movements of different asset classes.

A module titled Financial Data Science involved a final project worth 70% of the module grade. Myself and two class mates used web scraping techniques to scrape historical Financial Times headlines along with tweets from Twitter to find the sentiment of and feed into a machine learning algorithm to attempt to predict prices of a few different asset classes. The predictive power of the different sentiment sources was compared to the results of the different asset classes.

Attached is the full report and the two python files. One for scraping Financial Times headlines, and one for scrapping tweets.
